# Aptos Multi-Chain Asset Aggregated CLOB Trading Platform

A comprehensive Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) trading platform built on Aptos that aggregates liquidity from multiple sources including native Aptos DEXs and cross-chain assets.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Move Smart Contracts** (`/move-contracts/`)
   - `OrderVerification.move` - Order signature validation
   - `LiquidationGuard.move` - Liquidation safety mechanisms
   - `ClobCore.move` - Central order matching engine

2. **React Frontend** (`/frontend/`)
   - Real-time orderbook visualization
   - Trading dashboard with analytics
   - Wallet integration (Petra/Martian)
   - Cross-chain asset management

3. **Backend Services** (`/backend/`)
   - API aggregation layer
   - Cross-chain bridge integration
   - Real-time data processing

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-Source Liquidity**: Aggregates from Merkle Trade, Hyperion, Tapp Exchange
- **Cross-Chain Assets**: Supports assets from multiple chains via Ekiden Bridge
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Low-latency trading data and backtesting tools
- **Move Security**: Native security features with formal verification
- **Parallel Execution**: Optimized for Aptos' parallel transaction processing

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Blockchain**: Aptos (Move language)
- **Frontend**: React + Aptos UI Kit v2 + Recharts
- **Backend**: Node.js + Aptos TS SDK v1.10.0
- **Cross-Chain**: Ekiden Bridge SDK v0.8.2
- **Testing**: Cypress (E2E) + Aptos Move Prover
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend) + Aptos Testnet
